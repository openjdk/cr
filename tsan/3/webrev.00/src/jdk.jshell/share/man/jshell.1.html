  75 .SH DESCRIPTION
  76 .PP
  77 JShell provides a way to interactively evaluate declarations,
  78 statements, and expressions of the Java programming language, making it
  79 easier to learn the language, explore unfamiliar code and APIs, and
  80 prototype complex code.
  81 Java statements, variable definitions, method definitions, class
  82 definitions, import statements, and expressions are accepted.
  83 The bits of code entered are called snippets.
  84 .PP
  85 As snippets are entered, they\[aq]re evaluated, and feedback is
  86 provided.
  87 Feedback varies from the results and explanations of actions to nothing,
  88 depending on the snippet entered and the feedback mode chosen.
  89 Errors are described regardless of the feedback mode.
  90 Start with the verbose mode to get the most feedback while learning the
  91 tool.
  92 .PP
  93 Command\-line options are available for configuring the initial
  94 environment when JShell is started.
  95 Within JShell, commands are available for modifying the environment as
  96 needed.
  97 .PP
  98 Existing snippets can be loaded from a file to initialize a JShell
  99 session, or at any time within a session.
 100 Snippets can be modified within the session to try out different
 101 variations and make corrections.
 102 To keep snippets for later use, save them to a file.

1083 .SS Command abbreviations
1084 .PP
1085 An abbreviation of a command is accepted if the abbreviation uniquely
1086 identifies a command.
1087 For example, \f[CB]/l\f[R] is recognized as the \f[CB]/list\f[R] command.
1088 However, \f[CB]/s\f[R] isn\[aq]t a valid abbreviation because it can\[aq]t
1089 be determined if the \f[CB]/set\f[R] or \f[CB]/save\f[R] command is meant.
1090 Use \f[CB]/se\f[R] for the \f[CB]/set\f[R] command or \f[CB]/sa\f[R] for the
1091 \f[CB]/save\f[R] command.
1092 .PP
1093 Abbreviations are also accepted for subcommands, command arguments, and
1094 command options.
1095 For example, use \f[CB]/m\ \-a\f[R] to display all methods.
1096 .SS History navigation
1097 .PP
1098 A history of what was entered is maintained across sessions.
1099 Use the up and down arrows to scroll through commands and snippets from
1100 the current and past sessions.
1101 Use the Ctrl key with the up and down arrows to skip all but the first
1102 line of multiline snippets.
1103 .SS History search
1104 .PP
1105 Use the Ctrl+R key combination to search the history for the string
1106 entered.
1107 The prompt changes to show the string and the match.
1108 Ctrl+R searches backwards from the current location in the history
1109 through earlier entries.
1110 Ctrl+S searches forward from the current location in the history though
1111 later entries.

1355 maximum length of a displayed value.
1356 Predefined feedback modes are provided.
1357 Commands for creating custom feedback modes are also provided.
1358 .PP
1359 Use the \f[CB]/set\ mode\f[R] command to create a new feedback mode.
1360 In the following example, the new mode \f[CB]mymode\f[R], is based on the
1361 predefined feedback mode, \f[CB]normal\f[R], and verifying command
1362 feedback is displayed:
1363 .IP
1364 .nf
1365 \f[CB]
1366 jshell&gt;\ /set\ mode\ mymode\ normal\ \-command
1367 |\ \ Created\ new\ feedback\ mode:\ mymode
1368 \f[R]
1369 .fi
1370 .PP
1371 Because the new mode is based on the \f[CB]normal\f[R] mode, the prompts
1372 are the same.
1373 The following example shows how to see what prompts are used and then
1374 changes the prompts to custom strings.
1375 The first string represents the standard JShell prompt.
1376 The second string represents the prompt for additional lines in
1377 multiline snippets.

1385 \f[R]
1386 .fi
1387 .PP
1388 The maximum length of a displayed value is controlled by the truncation
1389 setting.
1390 Different types of values can have different lengths.
1391 The following example sets an overall truncation value of 72, and a
1392 truncation value of 500 for variable value expressions:
1393 .IP
1394 .nf
1395 \f[CB]
1396 jshell&gt;\ /set\ truncation\ mymode\ 72
1397 
1398 jshell&gt;\ /set\ truncation\ mymode\ 500\ varvalue
1399 \f[R]
1400 .fi
1401 .PP
1402 The feedback displayed after snippets are entered is controlled by the
1403 format setting and is based on the type of snippet entered and the
1404 action taken for that snippet.
1405 In the predefined mode \f[CB]normal\f[R], the string \f[CB]created\f[R] is
1406 displayed when a method is created.
1407 The following example shows how to change that string to
