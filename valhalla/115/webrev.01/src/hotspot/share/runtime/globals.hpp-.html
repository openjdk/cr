  38 // develop flags are settable / visible only during development and are constant in the PRODUCT version
  39 // product flags are always settable / visible
  40 // notproduct flags are settable / visible only during development and are not declared in the PRODUCT version
  41 
  42 // A flag must be declared with one of the following types:
  43 // bool, int, uint, intx, uintx, size_t, ccstr, ccstrlist, double, or uint64_t.
  44 // The type &quot;ccstr&quot; and &quot;ccstrlist&quot; are an alias for &quot;const char*&quot; and is used
  45 // only in this file, because the macrology requires single-token type names.
  46 
  47 // Note: Diagnostic options not meant for VM tuning or for product modes.
  48 // They are to be used for VM quality assurance or field diagnosis
  49 // of VM bugs.  They are hidden so that users will not be encouraged to
  50 // try them as if they were VM ordinary execution options.  However, they
  51 // are available in the product version of the VM.  Under instruction
  52 // from support engineers, VM customers can turn them on to collect
  53 // diagnostic information about VM problems.  To use a VM diagnostic
  54 // option, you must first specify +UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions.
  55 // (This master switch also affects the behavior of -Xprintflags.)
  56 //
  57 // experimental flags are in support of features that are not
  58 //    part of the officially supported product, but are available
  59 //    for experimenting with. They could, for example, be performance
  60 //    features that may not have undergone full or rigorous QA, but which may
  61 //    help performance in some cases and released for experimentation
  62 //    by the community of users and developers. This flag also allows one to
  63 //    be able to build a fully supported product that nonetheless also
  64 //    ships with some unsupported, lightly tested, experimental features.
  65 //    Like the UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions flag above, there is a corresponding
  66 //    UnlockExperimentalVMOptions flag, which allows the control and
  67 //    modification of the experimental flags.
  68 //
  69 // Nota bene: neither diagnostic nor experimental options should be used casually,
  70 //    and they are not supported on production loads, except under explicit
  71 //    direction from support engineers.
  72 //
  73 // manageable flags are writeable external product flags.
  74 //    They are dynamically writeable through the JDK management interface
  75 //    (com.sun.management.HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean API) and also through JConsole.
  76 //    These flags are external exported interface (see CCC).  The list of
  77 //    manageable flags can be queried programmatically through the management
  78 //    interface.
  79 //
  80 //    A flag can be made as &quot;manageable&quot; only if
  81 //    - the flag is defined in a CCC as an external exported interface.
  82 //    - the VM implementation supports dynamic setting of the flag.
  83 //      This implies that the VM must *always* query the flag variable
  84 //      and not reuse state related to the flag state at any given time.
  85 //    - you want the flag to be queried programmatically by the customers.
  86 //
  87 // product_rw flags are writeable internal product flags.
  88 //    They are like &quot;manageable&quot; flags but for internal/private use.
  89 //    The list of product_rw flags are internal/private flags which
  90 //    may be changed/removed in a future release.  It can be set
  91 //    through the management interface to get/set value
  92 //    when the name of flag is supplied.
  93 //
  94 //    A flag can be made as &quot;product_rw&quot; only if
  95 //    - the VM implementation supports dynamic setting of the flag.
  96 //      This implies that the VM must *always* query the flag variable
  97 //      and not reuse state related to the flag state at any given time.
  98 //
  99 // Note that when there is a need to support develop flags to be writeable,
 100 // it can be done in the same way as product_rw.
