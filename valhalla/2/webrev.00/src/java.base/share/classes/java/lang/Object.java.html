188      * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only

190      * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
191      * need to be modified.
192      * &lt;p&gt;
193      * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
194      * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
195      * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
196      * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
197      * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
198      * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
199      * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
200      * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
201      * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
202      * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
203      * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
204      * performs a &quot;shallow copy&quot; of this object, not a &quot;deep copy&quot; operation.
205      * &lt;p&gt;
206      * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
207      * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object

367      * Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes
368      * and lies dormant until one of the following occurs:
369      * &lt;ul&gt;
370      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
371      * object and thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
372      * the thread to be awakened.
373      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
374      * object.
375      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
376      * thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
377      * &lt;li&gt;The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.
378      * The amount of real time, in nanoseconds, is given by the expression
379      * {@code 1000000 * timeoutMillis + nanos}. If {@code timeoutMillis} and {@code nanos}
380      * are both zero, then real time is not taken into consideration and the
381      * thread waits until awakened by one of the other causes.
382      * &lt;li&gt;Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is awakened spuriously. (See below.)
383      * &lt;/ul&gt;
384      * &lt;p&gt;
385      * The thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is then removed from the wait set for this
386      * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It competes in the
387      * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
388      * object; once it has regained control of the object, all its
389      * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
390      * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
391      * method was invoked. Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then returns from the
392      * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
393      * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
394      * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
395      * was invoked.
396      * &lt;p&gt;
397      * A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a
398      * so-called &lt;em&gt;spurious wakeup&lt;/em&gt;.  While this will rarely occur in practice,
399      * applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should
400      * have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition
401      * is not satisfied. See the example below.
402      * &lt;p&gt;
403      * For more information on this topic, see section 14.2,
404      * &quot;Condition Queues,&quot; in Brian Goetz and others&#39; &lt;em&gt;Java Concurrency
405      * in Practice&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua
406      * Bloch&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Effective Java, Second Edition&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley,
407      * 2008).
408      * &lt;p&gt;
409      * If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupted}
410      * by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an {@code InterruptedException}
411      * is thrown.  The &lt;em&gt;interrupted status&lt;/em&gt; of the current thread is cleared when
412      * this exception is thrown. This exception is not thrown until the lock status of
413      * this object has been restored as described above.
414      *
415      * @apiNote
416      * The recommended approach to waiting is to check the condition being awaited in
417      * a {@code while} loop around the call to {@code wait}, as shown in the example
418      * below. Among other things, this approach avoids problems that can be caused
419      * by spurious wakeups.

464      * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
465      * determines that there are no more references to the object.
466      * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
467      * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
468      * &lt;p&gt;
469      * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
470      * if and when the Java&amp;trade; virtual
471      * machine has determined that there is no longer any
472      * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
473      * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
474      * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
475      * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
476      * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
477      * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
478      * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
479      * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
480      * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
481      * permanently discarded.
482      * &lt;p&gt;
483      * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
484      * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
485      * {@code Object} may override this definition.
486      * &lt;p&gt;
487      * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
488      * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
489      * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
490      * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
491      * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
492      * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
493      * &lt;p&gt;
494      * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
495      * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
496      * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
497      * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
498      * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
499      * at which point the object may be discarded.
500      * &lt;p&gt;
501      * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
502      * virtual machine for any given object.
503      * &lt;p&gt;
504      * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
505      * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
506      * ignored.
507      *
508      * @apiNote
509      * Classes that embed non-heap resources have many options
510      * for cleanup of those resources. The class must ensure that the
511      * lifetime of each instance is longer than that of any resource it embeds.
512      * {@link java.lang.ref.Reference#reachabilityFence} can be used to ensure that
513      * objects remain reachable while resources embedded in the object are in use.
514      * &lt;p&gt;
515      * A subclass should avoid overriding the {@code finalize} method
516      * unless the subclass embeds non-heap resources that must be cleaned up
517      * before the instance is collected.
518      * Finalizer invocations are not automatically chained, unlike constructors.
519      * If a subclass overrides {@code finalize} it must invoke the superclass
520      * finalizer explicitly.
521      * To guard against exceptions prematurely terminating the finalize chain,
522      * the subclass should use a {@code try-finally} block to ensure
523      * {@code super.finalize()} is always invoked. For example,
524      * &lt;pre&gt;{@code      @Override
525      *     protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
526      *         try {
527      *             ... // cleanup subclass state
528      *         } finally {
529      *             super.finalize();
530      *         }
531      *     }
532      * }&lt;/pre&gt;
533      *
534      * @deprecated The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic.
535      * Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs.
536      * Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel
537      * finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified
538      * among calls to {@code finalize} methods of different objects.
539      * Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization.
540      * The {@code finalize} method might be called on a finalizable object
541      * only after an indefinite delay, if at all.
542      *
543      * Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method
544      * to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also
545      * implement {@link AutoCloseable} if appropriate.
546      * The {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference}
547      * provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object
548      * becomes unreachable.
