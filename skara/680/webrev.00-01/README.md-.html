  1 # OpenJDK Project Skara
  2 
  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-sync - sync the personal fork of the project with the current state of the upstream repository
 16 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 17 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 18 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 19 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 20 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 21 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 22 - git-trees - run a git command in a tree of repositories
 23 - git-publish - publishes a local branch to a remote repository
 24 
 25 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 26 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 27 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 28 
 29 - git-openjdk-import
 30 - git-verify-import
 31 - hg-openjdk-import
 32 
 33 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 34 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 35 
 36 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 37 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 38 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 39 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 40 - submit - example pull request test runner
 41 - forward - forward commits to various repositories
 42 - mirror - mirror repositories
 43 - merge - merge commits between different repositories and/or branches
 44 - test - test runner
 45 
 46 ## Building
 47 
 48 [JDK 14](http://jdk.java.net/14/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 49 6.4.1 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
 50 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 51 
 52 ```bash
 53 $ sh gradlew
 54 ```
 55 
 56 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 57 
 58 ```bat
 59 &gt; gradlew
 60 ```
 61 
 62 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 63 tree root. _Note_ that the above commands will build the CLI tools, if you
 64 also want to build the bot images run `sh gradlew images` on GNU/Linux or
 65 `gradlew images` on Windows.
 66 
 67 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 68 
 69 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 70 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
 71 ensure that you have JDK 14 or later installed locally. You can then run the
 72 following command from the source tree root:
 73 
 74 ```bash
 75 $ sh gradlew
 76 ```
 77 
 78 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 79 tree root.
 80 
 81 ### Offline builds
 82 
 83 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 84 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 85 
 86 - JDK 14 or later
 87 - Gradle 6.4.1 or later
 88 
 89 To create a build then run the command:
 90 
 91 ```bash
 92 $ gradle offline
 93 ```
 94 
 95 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 96 downloading Gradle.
 97 
 98 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 99 tree root.
100 
101 ### Cross-linking
102 
103 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
104 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
105 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
106 source tree root:
107 
108 ```bash
109 sh gradlew images
110 ```
111 
112 ### Makefile wrapper
113 
114 Skara also has a very thin Makefile wrapper for contributors who prefer to build
115 using `make`. To build the jlinked image for the CLI tools using `make`, run:
116 
117 ```bash
118 make
119 ```
120 
121 ## Installing
122 
123 There are multiple way to install the Skara CLI tools. The easiest way is to
124 just include `skara.gitconfig` in your global Git configuration file. You can also
125 install the Skara tools on your `$PATH`.
126 
127 ### Including skara.gitconfig
128 
129 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
130 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
131 GNU/Linux:
132 
133 ```bash
134 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
135 ```
136 
137 On Windows:
138 
139 ```bat
140 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
141 ```
142 
143 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
144 
145 ### Adding to PATH
146 
147 The Skara tools can also be added to `$PATH` on GNU/Linux and macOS and Git
148 will pick them up. You can either just extend `$PATH` with the `build/bin`
149 directory or you can copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`. To extend
150 `$PATH` with the `build/bin` directory, run:
151 
152 ```bash
153 $ sh gradlew
154 $ export PATH=&quot;$PWD/build/bin:$PATH&quot;
155 ```
156 
157 To copy the tools to a location already on `$PATH`, run:
158 
159 ```bash
160 $ make
161 $ make install prefix=/path/to/install/location
162 ```
163 
164 When running `make install` the default value of `prefix` is `$HOME/.local`.
165 
166 If you want `git help &lt;skara tool&gt;` (or the equivalent `man git-&lt;skara tool&gt;`
167 to work, you must also add the `cli/resources/man` directory to `$MANPATH`.
168 For instance, run this from the Skara top directory to add this to your
169 `.bashrc` file:
170 
171 ```
172 echo &quot;export MANPATH=\$MANPATH&quot;:$PWD/cli/resources/man &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
173 ```
174 
175 ## Testing
176 
177 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.6.2 or later is required to run the unit
178 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
179 
180 ```bash
181 $ sh gradlew test
182 ```
183 
184 If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:
185 
186 ```bash
187 $ make test
188 ```
189 
190 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.3 or later and
191 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.2 or later to be installed on
192 your system.
193 
194 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
195 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
196 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
197 source tree root:
198 
199 ```bash
200 $ sh gradlew reproduce
201 ```
202 
203 If you prefer to use the Makefile wrapper you can also run:
204 
205 ```bash
206 $ make reproduce
207 ```
208 
209 ## Developing
210 
211 There are no additional dependencies required for developing Skara if you can
212 already build and test it (see above for instructions). The command-line tools
213 and libraries supports all of GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows and can therefore be
214 developed on any of those operating systems. The bots primarily support macOS
215 and GNU/Linux and may require [Windows Subsystem for
216 Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) on Windows.
217 
218 Please see the sections below for instructions on setting up a particular editor
219 or IDE.
220 
221 ### Vim
222 
223 If you choose to use [Vim](https://vim.org) as your editor when working on Skara then you
224 probably also want to utilize the Makefile wrapper. The Makefile wrapper enables
225 to you to run `:make` and `:make tests` in Vim.
