  37 and Eclipse Babel 0.15.1 which may be included with this product.
  38 
  39 *Eclipse Public License - v 1.0*
  40 
  41 THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
  42 PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
  43 THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
  44 
  45 *1. DEFINITIONS*
  46 
  47 &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
  48 
  49 a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
  50 documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
  51 b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
  52 
  53 i) changes to the Program, and
  54 
  55 ii) additions to the Program;
  56 
  57 where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
  58 are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
  59 &#39;originates&#39; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
  60 Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf.
  61 Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are
  62 separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
  63 under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of
  64 the Program.
  65 
  66 &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
  67 
  68 &quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
  69 are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
  70 or when combined with the Program.
  71 
  72 &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
  73 Agreement.
  74 
  75 &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
  76 including all Contributors.
  77 
  78 *2. GRANT OF RIGHTS*
  79 
  80 a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  81 grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
  82 license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
  83 publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
  84 Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
  85 object code form.
  86 
  87 b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
  88 grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license
  89 under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
  90 otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
  91 source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
  92 combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
  93 Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
  94 Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
  95 Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
  96 which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
  97 
  98 c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
  99 licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
 100 provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
 101 patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
 102 Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
 103 any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
 104 or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
 105 granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
 106 secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
 107 example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient
 108 to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire
 109 that license before distributing the Program.
 110 
 111 d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
 112 copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
 113 license set forth in this Agreement.
 114 
 115 *3. REQUIREMENTS*
 116 
 117 A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
 118 under its own license agreement, provided that:
 119 
 120 a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 121 
 122 b) its license agreement:
 123 
 124 i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties
 125 and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions
 126 of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
 127 merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
 128 
 129 ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
 130 damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
 131 consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 132 
 133 iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
 134 offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
 135 
 136 iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
 137 Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
 138 manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
 139 
 140 When the Program is made available in source code form:
 141 
 142 a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 143 
 144 b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
 145 
 146 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
 147 within the Program.
 148 
 149 Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
 150 Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
 151 Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
 152 
 153 *4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION*
 154 
 155 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
 156 with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
 157 license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
 158 Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering
 159 should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
 160 other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in
 161 a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial
 162 Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
 163 Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and
 164 costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other
 165 legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 166 Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
 167 Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
 168 Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
 169 section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
 170 alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
 171 Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
 172 Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
 173 Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
 174 in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
 175 Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 176 
 177 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 178 product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 179 Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 180 claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 181 claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility
 182 alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
 183 defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
 184 performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
 185 Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
 186 must pay those damages.
 187 
 188 *5. NO WARRANTY*
 189 
 190 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED
 191 ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
 192 EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
 193 OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
 194 A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for
 195 determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program
 196 and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this
 197 Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program
 198 errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
 199 programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 200 
 201 *6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY*
 202 
 203 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
 204 ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
 205 INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
 206 WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
 207 LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
 208 NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
 209 DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
 210 HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 211 
 212 *7. GENERAL*
 213 
 214 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 215 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 216 the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
 217 by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
 218 extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 219 
 220 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
 221 a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
 222 itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
 223 hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s
 224 rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 225 litigation is filed.
 226 
 227 All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails
 228 to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
 229 and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
 230 becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under
 231 this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution
 232 of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s
 233 obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient
 234 relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 235 
 236 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
 237 but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may
 238 only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
 239 the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
 240 Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has
 241 the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the
 242 initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
 243 responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
 244 entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
 245 version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 246 distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
 247 received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
 248 published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
 249 its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
 250 Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses
 251 to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
 252 whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in
 253 the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 254 
 255 This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 256 intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to
 257 this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than
 258 one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights
 259 to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

 375 
 376    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

 379       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 380       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

 383       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 384       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 385       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 386       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 387       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 388       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 389       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 390       as of the date such litigation is filed.

 392    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 393       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 394       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 395       meet the following conditions:
 396 
 397       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 398           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 399 
 400       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 401           stating that You changed the files; and
 402 
 403       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 404           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 405           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 406           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 407           the Derivative Works; and
 408 
 409       (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
 410           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 411           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 412           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 413           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 414           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 415           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 416           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 417           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 418           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 419           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 420           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 421           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 422           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 423           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 424           as modifying the License.
 425 
 426       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 427       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 428       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 429       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 430       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 431       the conditions stated in this License.
 432 
 433    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 434       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 435       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 436       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 437       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 438       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 439       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 440 
 441    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 442       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 443       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 444       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 445 
 446    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 447       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 448       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
 449       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 450       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 451       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 452       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 453       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 454       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 455 
 456    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 457       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 458       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 459       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 460       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 461       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 462       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 463       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 464       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 465       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 466       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 467 
 468    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 469       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 470       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 471       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 472       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 473       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 474       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 475       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 476       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 477       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 613    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
 614 
 615    1. Definitions.
 616 
 617       &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
 618       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 619 
 620       &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
 621       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 622 
 623       &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
 624       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
 625       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
 626       &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
 627       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
 628       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 629       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 630 
 631       &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 632       exercising permissions granted by this License.
 633 
 634       &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 635       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 636       source, and configuration files.
 637 
 638       &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 639       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 640       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 641       and conversions to other media types.
 642 
 643       &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 644       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 645       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 646       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 647 
 648       &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 649       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 650       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 651       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 652       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 653       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 654       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 655 
 656       &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
 657       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 658       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 659       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 660       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 661       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
 662       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 663       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 664       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 665       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 666       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
 667       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
 668       designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
 669 
 670       &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 671       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 672       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 673 
 674    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 675       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 676       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 677       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 678       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 679       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 680 
 681    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 682       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 683       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 684       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 685       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 686       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 687       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 688       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 689       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 690       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 691       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 692       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 693       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 694       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 695       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 696 
 697    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 698       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 699       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 700       meet the following conditions:
 701 
 702       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 703           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 704 
 705       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 706           stating that You changed the files; and
 707 
 708       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 709           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 710           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 711           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 712           the Derivative Works; and
 713 
 714       (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
 715           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 716           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 717           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 718           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 719           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 720           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 721           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 722           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 723           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 724           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 725           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 726           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 727           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 728           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 729           as modifying the License.
 730 
 731       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 732       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 733       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 734       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 735       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 736       the conditions stated in this License.
 737 
 738    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 739       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 740       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 741       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 742       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 743       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 744       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 745 
 746    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 747       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 748       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 749       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 750 
 751    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 752       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 753       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
 754       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 755       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 756       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 757       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 758       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 759       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 760 
 761    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 762       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 763       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 764       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 765       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 766       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 767       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 768       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 769       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 770       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 771       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 772 
 773    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 774       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 775       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 776       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 777       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 778       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 779       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 780       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 781       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 782       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 862 the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 863 your programs, too.
 864 
 865   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 866 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 867 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 868 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 869 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 870 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 871 
 872   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 873 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 874 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 875 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 876 
 877   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 878 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 879 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 880 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 881 rights.
 882 
 883   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 884 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 885 distribute and/or modify the software.
 886 
 887   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
 888 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 889 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 890 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 891 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 892 authors&#39; reputations.
 893 
 894   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 895 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 896 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 897 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 898 patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.
 899 
 900   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 901 modification follow.
 902 
 903 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 904    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 905 
 906   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 907 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 908 under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
 909 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
 910 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 911 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 912 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 913 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 914 the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
 915 
 916 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 917 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 918 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 919 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 920 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 921 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 922 
 923   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
 924 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 925 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 926 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 927 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 928 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 929 along with the Program.
 930 
 931 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 932 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 933 
 934   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 935 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 936 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 937 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 938 
 939     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 940     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 941 
 942     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 943     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 944     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 945     parties under the terms of this License.
 946 
 947     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 948     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 949     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 950     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 951     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 952     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 953     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 954     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 955     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 956     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 957 
 958 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 959 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 960 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 961 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 962 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 963 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 964 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 965 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 966 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 967 
 968 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 969 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 970 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 971 collective works based on the Program.
 972 
 973 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 974 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 975 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 976 the scope of this License.
 977 
 978   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 979 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 980 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 981 
 982     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 983     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 984     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 985 
 986     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 987     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 988     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 989     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 990     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 991     customarily used for software interchange; or,
 992 
 993     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 994     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 995     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 996     received the program in object code or executable form with such
 997     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 998 
 999 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
1000 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
1001 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
1002 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
1003 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
1004 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
1005 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
1006 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
1007 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
1008 itself accompanies the executable.
1009 
1010 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
1011 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
1012 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
1013 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
1014 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
1015 
1016   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
1017 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
1018 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
1019 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
1020 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
1021 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
1022 parties remain in full compliance.
1023 
1024   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
1025 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
1026 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
1027 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
1028 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
1029 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
1030 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
1031 the Program or works based on it.
1032 
1033   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
1034 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
1035 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
1036 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
1037 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
1038 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
1039 this License.
1040 
1041   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
1042 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
1043 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
1044 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
1045 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
1046 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
1047 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
1048 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
1049 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
1050 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
1051 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
1052 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
1053 
1054 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
1055 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
1056 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
1057 circumstances.
1058 
1059 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
1060 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
1061 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
1062 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
1063 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
1064 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
1065 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
1066 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
1067 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
1068 impose that choice.
1069 
1070 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
1071 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
1072 
1073   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
1074 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
1075 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
1076 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
1077 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
1078 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
1079 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
1080 
1081   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
1082 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
1083 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
1084 address new problems or concerns.
1085 
1086 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
1087 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
1088 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
1089 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
1090 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
1091 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
1092 Foundation.
1093 
1094   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
1095 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
1096 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
1097 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
1098 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
1099 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
1100 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
1101 
1102 			    NO WARRANTY
1103 
1104   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
1105 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
1106 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
1107 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
1108 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
1109 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
1110 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
1111 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
1112 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
1113 
1114   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
1115 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
1116 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
1117 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
1118 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
1119 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
1120 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
1121 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
1122 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
1123 
1124 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1125 
1126 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
1127 
1128   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
1129 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
1130 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
1131 
1132   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
1133 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
1134 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
1135 the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
1136 
1137     &lt;Html5shiv, The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in
1138     legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9,
1139     Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.&gt;

1143     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

1151 
1152     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

1155 
1156 
1157 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
1158 
1159 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
1160 when it starts in an interactive mode:
1161 
1162     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 2014  Alexander Farkas (aFarkas)
1163     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
1164     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
1165     under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
1166 
1167 The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate
1168 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
1169 be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be
1170 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
1171 
1172 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
1173 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
1174 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
1175 
1176   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
1177   `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

1181 
1182 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
1183 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
1184 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
1185 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
1186 Public License instead of this License.

1201         THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
1202         PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
1203         OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&#39;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1204 
1205     1. DEFINITIONS
1206 
1207     &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
1208 
1209       a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
1210          Distributed under this Agreement, and
1211 
1212       b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
1213          i) changes to the Program, and 
1214          ii) additions to the Program;
1215       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
1216       and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
1217       &quot;originates&quot; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
1218       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&#39;s behalf.
1219       Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
1220       are not Modified Works.
1221 
1222     &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
1223 
1224     &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
1225     are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
1226     or when combined with the Program.
1227 
1228     &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
1229     Agreement.
1230 
1231     &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
1232     or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
1233 
1234     &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
1235     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
1236     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
1237     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
1238 
1239     &quot;Modified Works&quot; shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
1240     results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
1241     contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
1242     in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
1243     Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
1244     interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
1245     in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
1246     or Modified Works thereof.
1247 
1248     &quot;Distribute&quot; means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
1249     in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
1250 
1251     &quot;Source Code&quot; means the form of a Program preferred for making
1252     modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
1253     documentation source, and configuration files.
1254 
1255     &quot;Secondary License&quot; means either the GNU General Public License,
1256     Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
1257     exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
1258     Contributor.
1259 
1260     2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
1261 
1262       a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
1263       grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
1264       license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
1265       publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
1266       Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
1267 
1268       b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
1269       grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
1270       license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
1271       import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
1272       if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
1273       apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
1274       the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
1275       of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
1276       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
1277       combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
1278       licensed hereunder.
1279 
1280       c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
1281       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
1282       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
1283       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
1284       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
1285       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
1286       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
1287       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
1288       assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
1289       property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
1290       patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
1291       Program, it is Recipient&#39;s responsibility to acquire that license
1292       before distributing the Program.
1293 
1294       d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
1295       sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
1296       the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
1297 
1298       e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
1299       Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
1300       those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient&#39;s
1301       receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
1302       (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
1303 
1304     3. REQUIREMENTS
1305 
1306     3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
1307 
1308       a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
1309       accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
1310       the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
1311       is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
1312       obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
1313       used for software exchange; and
1314 
1315       b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
1316       different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
1317          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
1318          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
1319          warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
1320          implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
1321          for a particular purpose;
1322 
1323          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
1324          liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
1325          incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
1326 
1327          iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&#39; rights
1328          in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
1329 
1330          iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
1331          party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
1332          of this section 3.
1333 
1334     3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
1335 
1336       a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
1337       Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
1338       files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
1339       Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
1340       Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
1341       under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
1342 
1343       b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
1344       the Program.
1345 
1346     3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
1347     trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
1348     of liability (&quot;notices&quot;) contained within the Program from any copy of
1349     the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
1350     their own appropriate notices.
1351 
1352     4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
1353 
1354     Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
1355     with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
1356     license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
1357     the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
1358     offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
1359     liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
1360     the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
1361     (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
1362     other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses,
1363     damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits
1364     and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
1365     Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
1366     Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
1367     in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
1368     apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
1369     intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
1370     Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
1371     writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
1372     and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
1373     related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
1374     participate in any such claim at its own expense.
1375 
1376     For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
1377     product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
1378     Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
1379     claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
1380     claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&#39;s responsibility
1381     alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
1382     defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
1383     claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
1384     pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
1385     those damages.
1386 
1387     5. NO WARRANTY
1388 
1389     EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
1390     PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot;
1391     BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
1392     IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
1393     TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
1394     PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
1395     appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
1396     risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
1397     including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
1398     compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
1399     or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
1400 
1401     6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
1402 
1403     EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
1404     PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
1405     SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
1406     EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
1407     PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
1408     CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
1409     ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
1410     EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
1411     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
1412 
1413     7. GENERAL
1414 
1415     If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
1416     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
1417     the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
1418     action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
1419     minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
1420 
1421     If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
1422     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
1423     Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
1424     or hardware) infringes such Recipient&#39;s patent(s), then such Recipient&#39;s
1425     rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
1426     litigation is filed.
1427 
1428     All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
1429     fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
1430     Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
1431     time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s
1432     rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
1433     and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
1434     However, Recipient&#39;s obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
1435     granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
1436 
1437     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
1438     but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
1439     may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
1440     reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
1441     this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
1442     Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
1443     is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
1444     responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
1445     entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
1446     version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
1447     Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
1448     received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
1449     Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
1450     Contributions) under the new version.
1451 
1452     Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
1453     receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
1454     Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
1455     estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
1456     under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
1457     to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
1458     No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
1459 
1460     Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
1461 
1462     &quot;This Source Code may also be made available under the following 
1463     Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth 
1464     in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),
1465     version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.&quot;
1466 
1467       Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
1468       is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
1469 
1470       If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
1471       file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
1472       file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to
1473       look for such a notice.
1474 
1475       You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

1481     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
1482     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
1483     Boston, MA 02110-1335
1484     USA
1485 
1486     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
1487     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
1488 
1489     Preamble
1490 
1491     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
1492     share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
1493     intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
1494     make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
1495     License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&#39;s software and
1496     to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
1497     Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
1498     Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
1499 
1500     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
1501     Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
1502     freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
1503     service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
1504     want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
1505     free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
1506 
1507     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
1508     to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
1509     restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
1510     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
1511 
1512     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
1513     or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
1514     You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
1515     And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
1516 
1517     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
1518     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
1519     distribute and/or modify the software.
1520 
1521     Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
1522     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
1523     software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
1524     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
1525     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
1526     authors&#39; reputations.
1527 
1528     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
1529     We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
1530     individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
1531     proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
1532     be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.
1533 
1534     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
1535     modification follow.
1536 
1537     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
1538 
1539     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
1540     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
1541     the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers
1542     to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means
1543     either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
1544     to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
1545     verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
1546     (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
1547     &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
1548 
1549     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
1550     covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
1551     the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
1552     covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
1553     (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
1554     is true depends on what the Program does.
1555 
1556     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s source
1557     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
1558     and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
1559     and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
1560     this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
1561     recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
1562 
1563     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
1564     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
1565 
1566     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
1567     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
1568     such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
1569     that you also meet all of these conditions:
1570 
1571         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
1572         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
1573 
1574         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
1575         whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
1576         thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
1577         under the terms of this License.
1578 
1579         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
1580         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
1581         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
1582         announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
1583         that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
1584         warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
1585         conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
1586         (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
1587         normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
1588         is not required to print an announcement.)
1589 
1590     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
1591     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
1592     can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
1593     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
1594     sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
1595     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
1596     the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
1597     License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
1598     whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
1599 
1600     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
1601     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
1602     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
1603     collective works based on the Program.
1604 
1605     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
1606     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
1607     storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
1608     scope of this License.
1609 
1610     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
1611     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
1612     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
1613 
1614         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
1615         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
1616         and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
1617 
1618         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
1619         years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
1620         of physically performing source distribution, a complete
1621         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
1622         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
1623         customarily used for software interchange; or,
1624 
1625         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
1626         distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
1627         only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
1628         program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
1629         accord with Subsection b above.)
1630 
1631     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
1632     making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
1633     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
1634     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
1635     compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
1636     exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
1637     normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
1638     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
1639     which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
1640     executable.
1641 
1642     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
1643     to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
1644     the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
1645     code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
1646     along with the object code.
1647 
1648     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
1649     except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
1650     to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
1651     automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
1652     who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
1653     not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
1654     full compliance.
1655 
1656     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
1657     signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
1658     distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
1659     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
1660     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
1661     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
1662     its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
1663     Program or works based on it.
1664 
1665     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
1666     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
1667     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
1668     these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
1669     on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
1670     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
1671 
1672     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
1673     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
1674     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
1675     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
1676     excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
1677     so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
1678     any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
1679     distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
1680     not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
1681     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
1682     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
1683     distribution of the Program.
1684 
1685     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
1686     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
1687     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
1688     circumstances.
1689 
1690     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
1691     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
1692     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
1693     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
1694     by public license practices. Many people have made generous
1695     contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
1696     system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
1697     the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
1698     software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
1699 
1700     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
1701     a consequence of the rest of this License.
1702 
1703     8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
1704     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
1705     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
1706     add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
1707     countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
1708     not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
1709     limitation as if written in the body of this License.
1710 
1711     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
1712     versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
1713     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
1714     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
1715 
1716     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
1717     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
1718     later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
1719     conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
1720     the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
1721     number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
1722     Free Software Foundation.
1723 
1724     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
1725     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
1726     author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
1727     Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
1728     sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
1729     two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
1730     software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
1731 
1732     NO WARRANTY
1733 
1734     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
1735     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
1736     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
1737     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
1738     EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
1739     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
1740     ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
1741     YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
1742     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
1743 
1744     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
1745     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
1746     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
1747     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
1748     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
1749     (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
1750     INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
1751     THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
1752     OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
1753 
1754     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1755 
1756     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
1757 
1758     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
1759     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
1760     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
1761 
1762     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
1763     attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
1764     the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
1765     &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
1766 
1767         One line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.
1768         Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;
1769 
1770         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
1771         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
1772         the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
1773         (at your option) any later version.
1774 
1775         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
1776         WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
1777         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
1778         General Public License for more details.
1779 
1780         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
1781         along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
1782         Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
1783 
1784     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
1785 
1786     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
1787     when it starts in an interactive mode:
1788 
1789         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
1790         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
1791         `show w&#39;. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
1792         it under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
1793 
1794     The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the
1795     appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
1796     you use may be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they
1797     could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
1798 
1799     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
1800     school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
1801     necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
1802 
1803         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
1804         program `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by

1810     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
1811     into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
1812     may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
1813     with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
1814     General Public License instead of this License.

1818 ## CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
1819 
1820     Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
1821     making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
1822     conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
1823     combination.
1824 
1825     As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
1826     permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
1827     executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
1828     modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
1829     terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
1830     independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
1831     module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
1832     based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
1833     exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
1834     do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
1835     from your version.

1845    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
1846 
1847    1. Definitions.
1848 
1849       &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
1850       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
1851 
1852       &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
1853       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
1854 
1855       &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
1856       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
1857       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
1858       &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
1859       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
1860       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
1861       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
1862 
1863       &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
1864       exercising permissions granted by this License.
1865 
1866       &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
1867       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
1868       source, and configuration files.
1869 
1870       &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
1871       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
1872       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
1873       and conversions to other media types.
1874 
1875       &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
1876       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
1877       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
1878       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
1879 
1880       &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
1881       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
1882       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
1883       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
1884       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
1885       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
1886       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
1887 
1888       &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
1889       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
1890       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
1891       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
1892       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
1893       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
1894       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
1895       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
1896       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
1897       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
1898       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
1899       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
1900       designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
1901 
1902       &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
1903       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
1904       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
1905 
1906    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
1907       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
1908       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
1909       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
1910       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
1911       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
1912 
1913    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
1914       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
1915       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
1916       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
1917       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
1918       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
1919       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
1920       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
1921       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
1922       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
1923       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
1924       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
1925       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
1926       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
1927       as of the date such litigation is filed.
1928 
1929    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
1930       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
1931       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
1932       meet the following conditions:
1933 
1934       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
1935           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
1936 
1937       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
1938           stating that You changed the files; and
1939 
1940       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
1941           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
1942           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
1943           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
1944           the Derivative Works; and
1945 
1946       (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
1947           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
1948           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
1949           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
1950           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
1951           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
1952           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
1953           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
1954           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
1955           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
1956           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
1957           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
1958           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
1959           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
1960           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
1961           as modifying the License.
1962 
1963       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
1964       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
1965       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
1966       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
1967       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
1968       the conditions stated in this License.
1969 
1970    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
1971       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
1972       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
1973       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
1974       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
1975       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
1976       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
1977 
1978    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
1979       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
1980       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
1981       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
1982 
1983    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
1984       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
1985       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
1986       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
1987       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
1988       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
1989       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
1990       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
1991       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
1992 
1993    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
1994       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
1995       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
1996       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
1997       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
1998       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
1999       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
2000       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
2001       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
2002       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
2003       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
2004 
2005    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
2006       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
2007       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
2008       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
2009       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
2010       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
2011       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
2012       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
2013       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
2014       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

2018    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
2019 
2020       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
2021       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;
2022       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don&#39;t include
2023       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
2024       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
2025       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
2026       same &quot;printed page&quot; as the copyright notice for easier
2027       identification within third-party archives.
