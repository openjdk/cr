  6  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  7  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  8 
  9 			    Preamble
 10 
 11   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 12 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 13 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 14 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 15 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 16 Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 17 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 18 the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 19 your programs, too.
 20 
 21   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 22 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 23 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 24 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 25 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 26 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 27 
 28   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 29 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 30 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 31 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 32 
 33   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 34 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 35 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 36 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 37 rights.
 38 
 39   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 40 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 41 distribute and/or modify the software.
 42 
 43   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain
 44 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 45 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 46 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 47 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 48 authors&#39; reputations.
 49 
 50   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 51 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 52 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 53 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 54 patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.
 55 
 56   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 57 modification follow.
 58 
 59 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 60    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 61 
 62   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 63 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 64 under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
 65 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
 66 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 67 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 68 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 69 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 70 the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
 71 
 72 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 73 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 74 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 75 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 76 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 77 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 78 
 79   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s
 80 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 81 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 82 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 83 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 84 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 85 along with the Program.
 86 
 87 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 88 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 89 
 90   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 91 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 92 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 93 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 94 
 95     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 96     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 97 
 98     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 99     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
100     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
101     parties under the terms of this License.
102 
103     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
104     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
105     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
106     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
107     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
108     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
109     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
110     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
111     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
112     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
113 
114 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
115 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
116 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
117 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
118 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
119 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
120 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
121 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
122 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
123 
124 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
125 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
126 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
127 collective works based on the Program.
128 
129 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
130 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
131 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
132 the scope of this License.
133 
134   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
135 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
136 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
137 
138     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
139     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
140     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
141 
142     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
143     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
144     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
145     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
146     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
147     customarily used for software interchange; or,
148 
149     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
150     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
151     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
152     received the program in object code or executable form with such
153     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
154 
155 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
156 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
157 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
158 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
159 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
160 special exception, the source code distributed need not include
161 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
162 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
163 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
164 itself accompanies the executable.
165 
166 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
167 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
168 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
169 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
170 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
171 
172   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
173 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
174 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
175 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
176 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
177 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
178 parties remain in full compliance.
179 
180   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
181 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
182 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
183 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
184 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
185 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
186 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
187 the Program or works based on it.
188 
189   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
190 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
191 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
192 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
193 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
194 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
195 this License.
196 
197   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
198 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
199 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
200 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
201 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
202 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
203 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
204 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
205 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
206 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
207 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
208 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
209 
210 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
211 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
212 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
213 circumstances.
214 
215 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
216 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
217 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
218 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
219 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
220 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
221 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
222 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
223 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
224 impose that choice.
225 
226 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
227 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
228 
229   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
230 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
231 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
232 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
233 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
234 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
235 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
236 
237   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
238 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
239 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
240 address new problems or concerns.
241 
242 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
243 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
244 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
245 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
246 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
247 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
248 Foundation.
249 
250   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
251 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
252 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
253 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
254 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
255 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
256 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
257 
258 			    NO WARRANTY
259 
260   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
261 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
262 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
263 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
264 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
265 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
266 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
267 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
268 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
269 
270   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
271 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
272 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
273 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
274 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
275 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
276 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
277 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
278 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
279 
280 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
281 
282 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
283 
284   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
285 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
286 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
287 
288   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
289 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
290 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
291 the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
292 
293     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
294     Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;
295 
296     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
297     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
298     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
299     (at your option) any later version.
300 
301     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
302     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
303     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
304     GNU General Public License for more details.
305 
306     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
307     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
308     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
309 
310 
311 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
312 
313 If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
314 when it starts in an interactive mode:
315 
316     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
317     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
318     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
319     under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
320 
321 The hypothetical commands `show w&#39; and `show c&#39; should show the appropriate
322 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
323 be called something other than `show w&#39; and `show c&#39;; they could even be
324 mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
325 
326 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
327 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
328 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
329 
330   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
331   `Gnomovision&#39; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
332 
333   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
334   Ty Coon, President of Vice
335 
336 This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
337 proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
338 consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
339 library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
340 Public License instead of this License.
