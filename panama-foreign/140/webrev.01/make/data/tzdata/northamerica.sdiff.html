  95 #	I don&#39;t really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
  96 #	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
  97 #	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
  98 #	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
  99 #	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
 100 #	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
 101 #	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
 102 #	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
 103 #	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
 104 #	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.

 114 # Shanks says that DST was called &quot;War Time&quot; in the US in 1918 and 1919.
 115 # However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
 116 # was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
 117 # time was just called &quot;Standard Time&quot; or &quot;Daylight Saving Time&quot;.

 119 # From Paul Eggert (2019-06-04):
 120 # Here is the legal basis for the US federal rules.
 121 # * Public Law 65-106 (1918-03-19) implemented standard and daylight saving
 122 #   time for the first time across the US, springing forward on March&#39;s last
 123 #   Sunday and falling back on October&#39;s last Sunday.
