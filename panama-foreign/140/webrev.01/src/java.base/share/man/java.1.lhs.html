 108 .RE
 109 .SH DESCRIPTION
 110 .PP
 111 The \f[CB]java\f[R] command starts a Java application.
 112 It does this by starting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), loading the
 113 specified class, and calling that class\[aq]s \f[CB]main()\f[R] method.
 114 The method must be declared \f[CB]public\f[R] and \f[CB]static\f[R], it must
 115 not return any value, and it must accept a \f[CB]String\f[R] array as a
 116 parameter.
 117 The method declaration has the following form:
 118 .RS
 119 .PP
 120 \f[CB]public\ static\ void\ main(String[]\ args)\f[R]
 121 .RE
 122 .PP
 123 In source\-file mode, the \f[CB]java\f[R] command can launch a class
 124 declared in a source file.
 125 See \f[B]Using Source\-File Mode to Launch Single\-File Source\-Code
 126 Programs\f[R] for a description of using the source\-file mode.
 127 .RS
 128 .PP
 129 \f[B]Note:\f[R] You can use the \f[CB]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] launcher
 130 environment variable to prepend its content to the actual command line
 131 of the \f[CB]java\f[R] launcher.
 132 See \f[B]Using the JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS Launcher Environment Variable\f[R].
 133 .RE
 134 .PP
 135 By default, the first argument that isn\[aq]t an option of the
 136 \f[CB]java\f[R] command is the fully qualified name of the class to be
 137 called.
 138 If \f[CB]\-jar\f[R] is specified, then its argument is the name of the JAR
 139 file containing class and resource files for the application.
 140 The startup class must be indicated by the \f[CB]Main\-Class\f[R] manifest
 141 header in its manifest file.
 142 .PP
 143 Arguments after the class file name or the JAR file name are passed to
 144 the \f[CB]main()\f[R] method.
 145 .SS \f[CB]javaw\f[R]
 146 .PP
 147 \f[B]Windows:\f[R] The \f[CB]javaw\f[R] command is identical to
 148 \f[CB]java\f[R], except that with \f[CB]javaw\f[R] there\[aq]s no associated
 149 console window.
 150 Use \f[CB]javaw\f[R] when you don\[aq]t want a command prompt window to
 151 appear.
 152 The \f[CB]javaw\f[R] launcher will, however, display a dialog box with
 153 error information if a launch fails.
 154 .SH USING SOURCE\-FILE MODE TO LAUNCH SINGLE\-FILE SOURCE\-CODE PROGRAMS
 155 .PP
 156 To launch a class declared in a source file, run the \f[CB]java\f[R]
 157 launcher in source\-file mode.
 158 Entering source\-file mode is determined by two items on the
 159 \f[CB]java\f[R] command line:
 160 .IP \[bu] 2
 161 The first item on the command line that is not an option or part of an
 162 option.
 163 In other words, the item in the command line that would otherwise be the
 164 main class name.
 165 .IP \[bu] 2
 166 The \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] \f[I]version\f[R] option, if present.
 167 .PP
 168 If the class identifies an existing file that has a \f[CB]\&amp;.java\f[R]
 169 extension, or if the \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] option is specified, then
 170 source\-file mode is selected.
 171 The source file is then compiled and run.
 172 The \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] option can be used to specify the source
 173 \f[I]version\f[R] or \f[I]N\f[R] of the source code.
 174 This determines the API that can be used.
 175 When you set \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] \f[I]N\f[R], you can only use the public
 176 API that was defined in JDK \f[I]N\f[R].
 177 .RS
 178 .PP
 179 \f[B]Note:\f[R] The valid values of \f[I]N\f[R] change for each release,
 180 with new values added and old values removed.
 181 You\[aq]ll get an error message if you use a value of \f[I]N\f[R] that is
 182 no longer supported.
 183 Supported values of \f[I]N\f[R] for this release are \f[CB]7\f[R],
 184 \f[CB]8\f[R], \f[CB]9\f[R], \f[CB]10\f[R], \f[CB]11\f[R], \f[CB]12\f[R],
 185 \f[CB]13\f[R], and \f[CB]14\f[R].
 186 .RE
 187 .PP
 188 If the file does not have the \f[CB]\&amp;.java\f[R] extension, the
 189 \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] option must be used to tell the \f[CB]java\f[R]
 190 command to use the source\-file mode.
 191 The \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] option is used for cases when the source file is
 192 a &quot;script&quot; to be executed and the name of the source file does not
 193 follow the normal naming conventions for Java source files.
 194 .PP
 195 In source\-file mode, the effect is as though the source file is
 196 compiled into memory, and the first class found in the source file is
 197 executed.
 198 Any arguments placed after the name of the source file in the original
 199 command line are passed to the compiled class when it is executed.
 200 .PP
 201 For example, if a file were named \f[CB]HelloWorld.java\f[R] and contained
 202 a class named \f[CB]hello.World\f[R], then the source\-file mode command
 203 to launch the class would be:
 204 .RS
 205 .PP
 206 \f[CB]java\ HelloWorld.java\f[R]
 207 .RE
 208 .PP
 209 The example illustrates that the class can be in a named package, and
 210 does not need to be in the unnamed package.
 211 This use of source\-file mode is informally equivalent to using the
 212 following two commands where \f[CB]hello.World\f[R] is the name of the
 213 class in the package:
 214 .IP
 215 .nf
 216 \f[CB]
 217 javac\ \-d\ &lt;memory&gt;\ HelloWorld.java
 218 java\ \-cp\ &lt;memory&gt;\ hello.World
 219 \f[R]
 220 .fi
 221 .PP
 222 \f[B]In source\-file mode, any additional command\-line options are
 223 processed as follows:\f[R]
 224 .IP \[bu] 2
 225 The launcher scans the options specified before the source file for any
 226 that are relevant in order to compile the source file.
 227 .RS 2
 228 .PP
 229 This includes: \f[CB]\-\-class\-path\f[R], \f[CB]\-\-module\-path\f[R],
 230 \f[CB]\-\-add\-exports\f[R], \f[CB]\-\-add\-modules\f[R],
 231 \f[CB]\-\-limit\-modules\f[R], \f[CB]\-\-patch\-module\f[R],
 232 \f[CB]\-\-upgrade\-module\-path\f[R], and any variant forms of those
 233 options.
 234 It also includes the new \f[CB]\-\-enable\-preview\f[R] option, described
 235 in JEP 12.
 236 .RE
 237 .IP \[bu] 2
 238 No provision is made to pass any additional options to the compiler,
 239 such as \f[CB]\-processor\f[R] or \f[CB]\-Werror\f[R].
 240 .IP \[bu] 2
 241 Command\-line argument files (\f[CB]\@\f[R]\-files) may be used in the
 242 standard way.
 243 Long lists of arguments for either the VM or the program being invoked
 244 may be placed in files specified on the command\-line by prefixing the
 245 filename with an \f[CB]\@\f[R] character.
 246 .PP
 247 \f[B]In source\-file mode, compilation proceeds as follows:\f[R]
 248 .IP \[bu] 2
 249 Any command\-line options that are relevant to the compilation
 250 environment are taken into account.
 251 .IP \[bu] 2
 252 No other source files are found and compiled, as if the source path is
 253 set to an empty value.
 254 .IP \[bu] 2
 255 Annotation processing is disabled, as if \f[CB]\-proc:none\f[R] is in
 256 effect.
 257 .IP \[bu] 2
 258 If a version is specified, via the \f[CB]\-\-source\f[R] option, the value
 259 is used as the argument for an implicit \f[CB]\-\-release\f[R] option for
 260 the compilation.
 261 This sets both the source version accepted by compiler and the system
 262 API that may be used by the code in the source file.
 263 .IP \[bu] 2
 264 The source file is compiled in the context of an unnamed module.
 265 .IP \[bu] 2
 266 The source file should contain one or more top\-level classes, the first
 267 of which is taken as the class to be executed.
 268 .IP \[bu] 2
 269 The compiler does not enforce the optional restriction defined at the
 270 end of JLS ??7.6, that a type in a named package should exist in a file
 271 whose name is composed from the type name followed by the
 272 \f[CB]\&amp;.java\f[R] extension.
 273 .IP \[bu] 2
 274 If the source file contains errors, appropriate error messages are
 275 written to the standard error stream, and the launcher exits with a
 276 non\-zero exit code.
 277 .PP
 278 \f[B]In source\-file mode, execution proceeds as follows:\f[R]
 279 .IP \[bu] 2
 280 The class to be executed is the first top\-level class found in the
 281 source file.
 282 It must contain a declaration of the standard
 283 \f[CB]public\ static\ void\ main(String[])\f[R] method.
 284 .IP \[bu] 2
 285 The compiled classes are loaded by a custom class loader, that delegates
 286 to the application class loader.
 287 This implies that classes appearing on the application class path cannot
 288 refer to any classes declared in the source file.
 289 .IP \[bu] 2
 290 The compiled classes are executed in the context of an unnamed module,
 291 as though \f[CB]\-\-add\-modules=ALL\-DEFAULT\f[R] is in effect.
 292 This is in addition to any other \f[CB]\-\-add\-module\f[R] options that
 293 may be have been specified on the command line.
 294 .IP \[bu] 2
 295 Any arguments appearing after the name of the file on the command line
 296 are passed to the standard main method in the obvious way.
 297 .IP \[bu] 2
 298 It is an error if there is a class on the application class path whose
 299 name is the same as that of the class to be executed.

 303 .SH USING THE JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS LAUNCHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
 304 .PP
 305 \f[CB]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] prepends its content to the options parsed
 306 from the command line.
 307 The content of the \f[CB]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] environment variable is a
 308 list of arguments separated by white\-space characters (as determined by
 309 \f[CB]isspace()\f[R]).
 310 These are prepended to the command line arguments passed to
 311 \f[CB]java\f[R] launcher.
 312 The encoding requirement for the environment variable is the same as the
 313 \f[CB]java\f[R] command line on the system.
 314 \f[CB]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] environment variable content is treated in the
 315 same manner as that specified in the command line.
 316 .PP
 317 Single (\f[CB]\[aq]\f[R]) or double (\f[CB]&quot;\f[R]) quotes can be used to
 318 enclose arguments that contain whitespace characters.
 319 All content between the open quote and the first matching close quote
 320 are preserved by simply removing the pair of quotes.
 321 In case a matching quote is not found, the launcher will abort with an
 322 error message.
 323 \f[CB]\@\f[R]\-files are supported as they are specified in the command
 324 line.
 325 However, as in \f[CB]\@\f[R]\-files, use of a wildcard is not supported.
 326 In order to mitigate potential misuse of \f[CB]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R]
 327 behavior, options that specify the main class (such as \f[CB]\-jar\f[R])
 328 or cause the \f[CB]java\f[R] launcher to exit without executing the main
 329 class (such as \f[CB]\-h\f[R]) are disallowed in the environment variable.
 330 If any of these options appear in the environment variable, the launcher
 331 will abort with an error message.
 332 When \f[CB]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] is set, the launcher prints a message to
 333 stderr as a reminder.

 353 The \f[CB]java\f[R] command supports a wide range of options in the
 354 following categories:
 355 .IP \[bu] 2
 356 \f[B]Standard Options for Java\f[R]: Options guaranteed to be supported
 357 by all implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 358 They\[aq]re used for common actions, such as checking the version of the
 359 JRE, setting the class path, enabling verbose output, and so on.
 360 .IP \[bu] 2
 361 \f[B]Extra Options for Java\f[R]: General purpose options that are
 362 specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine.
 363 They aren\[aq]t guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations,
 364 and are subject to change.
 365 These options start with \f[CB]\-X\f[R].
 366 .PP
 367 The advanced options aren\[aq]t recommended for casual use.
 368 These are developer options used for tuning specific areas of the Java
 369 HotSpot Virtual Machine operation that often have specific system
 370 requirements and may require privileged access to system configuration
 371 parameters.
 372 Several examples of performance tuning are provided in \f[B]Performance
 373 Tuning Examples\f[R].
 374 These options aren\[aq]t guaranteed to be supported by all JVM
 375 implementations and are subject to change.
 376 Advanced options start with \f[CB]\-XX\f[R].
 377 .IP \[bu] 2
 378 \f[B]Advanced Runtime Options for Java\f[R]: Control the runtime behavior
 379 of the Java HotSpot VM.
 380 .IP \[bu] 2
 381 \f[B]Advanced JIT Compiler Options for java\f[R]: Control the dynamic
 382 just\-in\-time (JIT) compilation performed by the Java HotSpot VM.
 383 .IP \[bu] 2
 384 \f[B]Advanced Serviceability Options for Java\f[R]: Enable gathering
 385 system information and performing extensive debugging.
 386 .IP \[bu] 2
 387 \f[B]Advanced Garbage Collection Options for Java\f[R]: Control how
 388 garbage collection (GC) is performed by the Java HotSpot
 389 .PP
 390 Boolean options are used to either enable a feature that\[aq]s disabled
 391 by default or disable a feature that\[aq]s enabled by default.
 392 Such options don\[aq]t require a parameter.
 393 Boolean \f[CB]\-XX\f[R] options are enabled using the plus sign
 394 (\f[CB]\-XX:+\f[R]\f[I]OptionName\f[R]) and disabled using the minus sign
 395 (\f[CB]\-XX:\-\f[R]\f[I]OptionName\f[R]).
 396 .PP
 397 For options that require an argument, the argument may be separated from
 398 the option name by a space, a colon (:), or an equal sign (=), or the
 399 argument may directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs for
 400 each option).
 401 If you\[aq]re expected to specify the size in bytes, then you can use no
 402 suffix, or use the suffix \f[CB]k\f[R] or \f[CB]K\f[R] for kilobytes (KB),
 403 \f[CB]m\f[R] or \f[CB]M\f[R] for megabytes (MB), or \f[CB]g\f[R] or \f[CB]G\f[R]
 404 for gigabytes (GB).
 405 For example, to set the size to 8 GB, you can specify either
 406 \f[CB]8g\f[R], \f[CB]8192m\f[R], \f[CB]8388608k\f[R], or \f[CB]8589934592\f[R]
 407 as the argument.
 408 If you are expected to specify the percentage, then use a number from 0
 409 to 1.
 410 For example, specify \f[CB]0.25\f[R] for 25%.

 473 Specifying \f[I]classpath\f[R] overrides any setting of the
 474 \f[CB]CLASSPATH\f[R] environment variable.
 475 If the class path option isn\[aq]t used and \f[I]classpath\f[R] isn\[aq]t
 476 set, then the user class path consists of the current directory (.).
 477 .PP
 478 As a special convenience, a class path element that contains a base name
 479 of an asterisk (*) is considered equivalent to specifying a list of all
 480 the files in the directory with the extension \f[CB]\&amp;.jar\f[R] or
 481 \f[CB]\&amp;.JAR\f[R] .
 482 A Java program can\[aq]t tell the difference between the two
 483 invocations.
 484 For example, if the directory mydir contains \f[CB]a.jar\f[R] and
 485 \f[CB]b.JAR\f[R], then the class path element mydir/* is expanded to
 486 \f[CB]A.jar:b.JAR\f[R], except that the order of JAR files is unspecified.
 487 All \f[CB]\&amp;.jar\f[R] files in the specified directory, even hidden ones,
 488 are included in the list.
 489 A class path entry consisting of an asterisk (*) expands to a list of
 490 all the jar files in the current directory.
 491 The \f[CB]CLASSPATH\f[R] environment variable, where defined, is similarly
 492 expanded.
 493 Any class path wildcard expansion that occurs before the Java VM is
 494 started.
 495 Java programs never see wildcards that aren\[aq]t expanded except by
 496 querying the environment, such as by calling
 497 \f[CB]System.getenv(&quot;CLASSPATH&quot;)\f[R].

 570 Disables assertions.
 571 By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes.
 572 With no arguments, \f[CB]\-disableassertions\f[R] (\f[CB]\-da\f[R]) disables
 573 assertions in all packages and classes.
 574 With the \f[I]packagename\f[R] argument ending in \f[CB]\&amp;...\f[R], the
 575 switch disables assertions in the specified package and any subpackages.
 576 If the argument is simply \f[CB]\&amp;...\f[R], then the switch disables
 577 assertions in the unnamed package in the current working directory.

 582 The \f[CB]\-disableassertions\f[R] (\f[CB]\-da\f[R]) option applies to all
 583 class loaders and to system classes (which don\[aq]t have a class
 584 loader).
 585 There\[aq]s one exception to this rule: If the option is provided with
 586 no arguments, then it doesn\[aq]t apply to system classes.
 587 This makes it easy to disable assertions in all classes except for
 588 system classes.
 589 The \f[CB]\-disablesystemassertions\f[R] option enables you to disable
 590 assertions in all system classes.
 591 To explicitly enable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the
 592 \f[CB]\-enableassertions\f[R] (\f[CB]\-ea\f[R]) option.
 593 Both options can be used at the same time.
 594 For example, to run the \f[CB]MyClass\f[R] application with assertions
 595 enabled in the package \f[CB]com.wombat.fruitbat\f[R] (and any
 596 subpackages) but disabled in the class

 610 Enables assertions.
 611 By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes.
 612 With no arguments, \f[CB]\-enableassertions\f[R] (\f[CB]\-ea\f[R]) enables
 613 assertions in all packages and classes.
 614 With the \f[I]packagename\f[R] argument ending in \f[CB]\&amp;...\f[R], the
 615 switch enables assertions in the specified package and any subpackages.
 616 If the argument is simply \f[CB]\&amp;...\f[R], then the switch enables
 617 assertions in the unnamed package in the current working directory.

 622 The \f[CB]\-enableassertions\f[R] (\f[CB]\-ea\f[R]) option applies to all

 624 loader).
 625 There\[aq]s one exception to this rule: If the option is provided with
 626 no arguments, then it doesn\[aq]t apply to system classes.
 627 This makes it easy to enable assertions in all classes except for system
 628 classes.
 629 The \f[CB]\-enablesystemassertions\f[R] option provides a separate switch
 630 to enable assertions in all system classes.
 631 To explicitly disable assertions in specific packages or classes, use
 632 the \f[CB]\-disableassertions\f[R] (\f[CB]\-da\f[R]) option.
 633 If a single command contains multiple instances of these switches, then
 634 they\[aq]re processed in order, before loading any classes.

2848 .PP
2849 RTM is part of Intel\[aq]s TSX, which is an x86 instruction set
2850 extension and facilitates the creation of multithreaded applications.
2851 RTM introduces the new instructions \f[CB]XBEGIN\f[R], \f[CB]XABORT\f[R],
2852 \f[CB]XEND\f[R], and \f[CB]XTEST\f[R].
2853 The \f[CB]XBEGIN\f[R] and \f[CB]XEND\f[R] instructions enclose a set of
2854 instructions to run as a transaction.
2855 If no conflict is found when running the transaction, then the memory
2856 and register modifications are committed together at the \f[CB]XEND\f[R]
2857 instruction.
2858 The \f[CB]XABORT\f[R] instruction can be used to explicitly abort a
2859 transaction and the \f[CB]XTEST\f[R] instruction checks if a set of
2860 instructions is being run in a transaction.
2861 .PP
2862 A lock on a transaction is inflated when another thread tries to access
2863 the same transaction, thereby blocking the thread that didn\[aq]t
2864 originally request access to the transaction.
2865 RTM requires that a fallback set of operations be specified in case a
2866 transaction aborts or fails.
2867 An RTM lock is a lock that has been delegated to the TSX\[aq]s system.
2868 .PP
2869 RTM improves performance for highly contended locks with low conflict in
2870 a critical region (which is code that must not be accessed by more than
2871 one thread concurrently).
2872 RTM also improves the performance of coarse\-grain locking, which
2873 typically doesn\[aq]t perform well in multithreaded applications.
2874 (Coarse\-grain locking is the strategy of holding locks for long periods
2875 to minimize the overhead of taking and releasing locks, while
2876 fine\-grained locking is the strategy of trying to achieve maximum
2877 parallelism by locking only when necessary and unlocking as soon as
2878 possible.) Also, for lightly contended locks that are used by different
2879 threads, RTM can reduce false cache line sharing, also known as cache
2880 line ping\-pong.
2881 This occurs when multiple threads from different processors are
2882 accessing different resources, but the resources share the same cache
2883 line.
2884 As a result, the processors repeatedly invalidate the cache lines of
2885 other processors, which forces them to read from main memory instead of
2886 their cache.

4252 The analytics process is divided into two parts.
4253 The first part examines the entire code heap and aggregates all

4255 The second part consists of several independent steps that print the

4411 Everything that can be specified on the command line can also be
4412 specified dynamically with the \f[CB]VM.log\f[R] command.

4454 .IP \[bu] 2
4455 \f[CB]stderr\f[R] \-\-\- Sends output to stderr
4456 .IP \[bu] 2
4457 \f[CB]file=\f[R]\f[I]filename\f[R] \-\-\- Sends output to text file(s).
4458 .PP
4459 When using \f[CB]file=\f[R]\f[I]filename\f[R], specifying \f[CB]%p\f[R]
4460 and/or \f[CB]%t\f[R] in the file name expands to the JVM\[aq]s PID and
4461 startup timestamp, respectively.
4462 You can also configure text files to handle file rotation based on file
4463 size and a number of files to rotate.
4464 For example, to rotate the log file every 10 MB and keep 5 files in
4465 rotation, specify the options \f[CB]filesize=10M,\ filecount=5\f[R].
4466 The target size of the files isn\[aq]t guaranteed to be exact, it\[aq]s
4467 just an approximate value.
4468 Files are rotated by default with up to 5 rotated files of target size
4469 20 MB, unless configured otherwise.
4470 Specifying \f[CB]filecount=0\f[R] means that the log file shouldn\[aq]t be
4471 rotated.
4472 There\[aq]s a possibility of the pre\-existing log file getting
4473 overwritten.
4474 .SS Decorations

4476 Logging messages are decorated with information about the message.
4477 You can configure each output to use a custom set of decorators.
4478 The order of the output is always the same as listed in the table.
4479 You can configure the decorations to be used at run time.
4480 Decorations are prepended to the log message.

4975 .SH VALIDATE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE FLAG ARGUMENTS
4976 .PP
4977 You use values provided to all Java Virtual Machine (JVM) command\-line
4978 flags for validation and, if the input value is invalid or
4979 out\-of\-range, then an appropriate error message is displayed.
4980 .PP
4981 Whether they\[aq]re set ergonomically, in a command line, by an input
4982 tool, or through the APIs (for example, classes contained in the package
4983 \f[CB]java.lang.management\f[R]) the values provided to all Java Virtual
4984 Machine (JVM) command\-line flags are validated.
4985 Ergonomics are described in Java Platform, Standard Edition HotSpot
4986 Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide.
4987 .PP
4988 Range and constraints are validated either when all flags have their
4989 values set during JVM initialization or a flag\[aq]s value is changed
4990 during runtime (for example using the \f[CB]jcmd\f[R] tool).
4991 The JVM is terminated if a value violates either the range or constraint
4992 check and an appropriate error message is printed on the error stream.
4993 .PP
4994 For example, if a flag violates a range or a constraint check, then the
4995 JVM exits with an error:
4996 .IP
4997 .nf
4998 \f[CB]
4999 java\ \-XX:AllocatePrefetchStyle=5\ \-version
5000 intx\ AllocatePrefetchStyle=5\ is\ outside\ the\ allowed\ range\ [\ 0\ ...\ 3\ ]
5001 Improperly\ specified\ VM\ option\ \[aq]AllocatePrefetchStyle=5\[aq]
5002 Error:\ Could\ not\ create\ the\ Java\ Virtual\ Machine.
5003 Error:\ A\ fatal\ exception\ has\ occurred.\ Program\ will\ exit.
5004 \f[R]
5005 .fi
5006 .PP
5007 The flag \f[CB]\-XX:+PrintFlagsRanges\f[R] prints the range of all the
5008 flags.
5009 This flag allows automatic testing of the flags by the values provided
5010 by the ranges.
5011 For the flags that have the ranges specified, the type, name, and the
5012 actual range is printed in the output.
5013 .PP
5014 For example,
5015 .IP
5016 .nf
5017 \f[CB]
5018 intx\ \ \ ThreadStackSize\ [\ 0\ ...\ 9007199254740987\ ]\ {pd\ product}
5019 \f[R]
5020 .fi
5021 .PP
5022 For the flags that don\[aq]t have the range specified, the values
5023 aren\[aq]t displayed in the print out.
5024 For example:
5025 .IP
5026 .nf
5027 \f[CB]
5028 size_t\ NewSize\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [\ \ \ ...\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ]\ {product}
5029 \f[R]
5030 .fi
5031 .PP
5032 This helps to identify the flags that need to be implemented.
5033 The automatic testing framework can skip those flags that don\[aq]t have
5034 values and aren\[aq]t implemented.
5035 .SH LARGE PAGES
5036 .PP
5037 You use large pages, also known as huge pages, as memory pages that are
5038 significantly larger than the standard memory page size (which varies
5039 depending on the processor and operating system).
5040 Large pages optimize processor Translation\-Lookaside Buffers.
5041 .PP
5042 A Translation\-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a page translation cache that
5043 holds the most\-recently used virtual\-to\-physical address
5044 translations.
5045 A TLB is a scarce system resource.
5046 A TLB miss can be costly because the processor must then read from the
5047 hierarchical page table, which may require multiple memory accesses.
5048 By using a larger memory page size, a single TLB entry can represent a
5049 larger memory range.
5050 This results in less pressure on a TLB, and memory\-intensive
5051 applications may have better performance.
5052 .PP
5053 However, large pages page memory can negatively affect system
5054 performance.
5055 For example, when a large mount of memory is pinned by an application,
5056 it may create a shortage of regular memory and cause excessive paging in
5057 other applications and slow down the entire system.
5058 Also, a system that has been up for a long time could produce excessive
5059 fragmentation, which could make it impossible to reserve enough large
5060 page memory.
5061 When this happens, either the OS or JVM reverts to using regular pages.

5084 If the output shows the three &quot;Huge&quot; variables, then your system can
5085 support large page memory but it needs to be configured.
5086 If the command prints nothing, then your system doesn\[aq]t support
5087 large pages.

5189 In JDK 11 and later, \f[CB]\-XX:+UseAppCDS\f[R] is obsolete and the

5586 The above command for specifying a base archive is useful if the base
5587 archive used for creating the dynamic archive has been moved.

5676 JDK 9 and later supports adding both symbols and string objects to an
5677 archive for memory sharing when you have multiple JVM processes running
5678 on the same host.
5679 An example of this is having multiple JVM processes that use the same
5680 set of Java EE classes.
5681 When these common classes are loaded and used, new symbols and strings
5682 may be created and added to the JVM\[aq]s internal &quot;symbol&quot; and &quot;string&quot;
5683 tables.
5684 At runtime, the symbols or string objects mapped from the archive file
5685 can be shared across multiple JVM processes, resulting in a reduction of
5686 overall memory usage.
5687 In addition, archiving strings also provides added performance benefits
5688 in both startup time and runtime execution.
5689 .PP
5690 In JDK 10 and later, CONSTANT_String entries in archived classes are
5691 resolved to interned String objects at dump time, and all interned
5692 String objects are archived.
5693 However, even though all CONSTANT_String literals in all archived
5694 classes are resolved, it might still beneficial to add additional
5695 strings that are not string literals in class files, but are likely to
5696 be used by your application at run time.
