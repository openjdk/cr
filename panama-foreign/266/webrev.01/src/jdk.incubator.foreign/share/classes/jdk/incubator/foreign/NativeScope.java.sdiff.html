 41  * This class provides a scope of given size, within which several allocations can be performed. An native scope is backed
 42  * by off-heap memory. Native scopes can be either &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt;, depending on whether the size
 43  * of the native scope is known statically. If an application knows before-hand how much memory it needs to allocate the values it needs,
 44  * using a &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; native scope will typically provide better performances than independently allocating the memory
 45  * for each value (e.g. using {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)}), or using an &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt; native scope.
 46  * For this reason, using a bounded native scope is recommended in cases where programs might need to emulate native stack allocation.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 48  * Allocation scopes are thread-confined (see {@link #ownerThread()}; as such, the resulting {@code MemoryAddress} instances</span>
 49  * returned by the native scope will be backed by memory segments confined by the same owner thread as the native scope.
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * To allow for more usability, it is possible for an native scope to reclaim ownership of an existing memory segments
 52  * (see {@link #register(MemorySegment)}). This might be useful to allow one or more segments which were independently
 53  * created to share the same life-cycle as a given native scope - which in turns enables client to group all memory
 54  * allocation and usage under a single &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources block&lt;/em&gt;.

 41  * This class provides a scope of given size, within which several allocations can be performed. An native scope is backed
 42  * by off-heap memory. Native scopes can be either &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt;, depending on whether the size
 43  * of the native scope is known statically. If an application knows before-hand how much memory it needs to allocate the values it needs,
 44  * using a &lt;em&gt;bounded&lt;/em&gt; native scope will typically provide better performances than independently allocating the memory
 45  * for each value (e.g. using {@link MemorySegment#allocateNative(long)}), or using an &lt;em&gt;unbounded&lt;/em&gt; native scope.
 46  * For this reason, using a bounded native scope is recommended in cases where programs might need to emulate native stack allocation.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
<span class="line-modified"> 48  * Allocation scopes are thread-confined (see {@link #ownerThread()}; as such, the resulting {@link MemorySegment} instances</span>
 49  * returned by the native scope will be backed by memory segments confined by the same owner thread as the native scope.
 50  * &lt;p&gt;
 51  * To allow for more usability, it is possible for an native scope to reclaim ownership of an existing memory segments
 52  * (see {@link #register(MemorySegment)}). This might be useful to allow one or more segments which were independently
 53  * created to share the same life-cycle as a given native scope - which in turns enables client to group all memory
 54  * allocation and usage under a single &lt;em&gt;try-with-resources block&lt;/em&gt;.
