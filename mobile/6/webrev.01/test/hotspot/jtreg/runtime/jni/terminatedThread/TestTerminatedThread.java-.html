 29  * @summary Basic test of Thread and ThreadMXBean queries on a natively
 30  *          attached thread that has failed to detach before terminating.
 31  * @comment The native code only supports POSIX so no windows testing; also
 32  *          we have to skip solaris as a terminating thread that fails to
 33  *          detach will hit an infinite loop due to TLS destructor issues - see
